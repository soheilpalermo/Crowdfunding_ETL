# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases the development of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline specifically designed to process and manage crowdfunding data. It involves extracting data from Excel files, transforming it into structured CSV formats, and creating a database. The project details the complete data flow into a PostgreSQL database, facilitating efficient querying and analysis. Key outcomes include generating data tables, visualising entity relationships, and constructing a scalable database to derive insights from crowdfunding data.
