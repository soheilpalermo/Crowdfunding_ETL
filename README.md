# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases the development of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline specifically designed to process and manage crowdfunding data. It involves extracting data from Excel files, transforming it into structured CSV formats, and creating a database. The project details the complete data flow into a PostgreSQL database, facilitating efficient querying and analysis. Key outcomes include generating data tables, visualising entity relationships, and constructing a scalable database to derive insights from crowdfunding data.

### Features
#### Data Extraction and Transformation
 - Extract crowdfunding and contact information from Excel files.
 - Transform data into standardized formats, creating DataFrames for each core data type.
#### Data Storage
 - Export processed data into four CSV files: Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact.
#### Database Design and Implementation
 - Develop a comprehensive Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model data relationships.
 - Define a PostgreSQL table schema to reflect the ERD structure.
 - Populate PostgreSQL tables with transformed data from CSV files.
