# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process and manage crowdfunding data. Through data extraction from Excel files, data transformation into structured CSV files, and database creation, the project lays out the end-to-end flow of data into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis. Key outcomes include generating data tables, visualizing entity relationships, and constructing a scalable database for crowdfunding insights.
